## üìÇ Featured Projects

- **[Robust Coordination and Control of Multi-Robot Systems Using Consensus Protocols](https://github.com/MosesEbere/multi-robot-consensus)**:

  This project focused on developing and implementing consensus protocol-based control strategies for multi-robot systems, particularly for rendezvous and formation control. Using graph theory, we modeled and controlled the dynamics of robot swarms in both distributed and semi-distributed settings. The experimental analysis was conducted in a dual-simulation environment, integrating Pygame and Stage Simulator with ROS, to assess the effectiveness of these protocols.
- **[Controlling a Swarm of Robots in a Simulator Stage using Reynolds‚Äô Rules](https://github.com/yourusername/project2)**:

  In this project, we programmed virtual robots to move together like a coordinated swarm, inspired by the natural movements of birds and fish and Craig Reynolds' behavioral rules. By applying simple principles like Separation, Alignment, and Cohesion, we created a simulation where the robots navigated collectively, avoided obstacles, and reached their destinations together.
